In this document, we explore the MPG dataset provided in the TidyVerse package. It will follow the model of the lab 1.2 exploration of the Seattle Pets dataset.

## Loading the MPG Dataset

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
summary(mpg)
```

This data set tells us the miles per gallon in the city and highway of certain vehicles along with other details about them.

## Reading and Writing Files

```{r}
mpg <- mpg %>%
  write_csv("data/mpg.csv")
```

Reading in the csv:

```{r}
mpg_data <- read_csv("data/mpg.csv")
summary(mpg_data)
```

As far as I can see, the csv version of this data set is identical, as it should be.

## Including Images

## Using Equations and Inline Code

RMarkdown also allows us to include equations and inline code computations. For example, Einstein's famous equation, $e = mc^2$, tells us that given the speed of light (29979245800 cm/second), the energy stored in a mass of 1 gram is: `r 1 * 29979245800**2`. (Yep, that's a pretty big number.)

The average city mpg is `r mean(mpg_data$cty)`,
The average highway mpg is `r mean(mpg_data$hwy)`.

## Using the Intermediate Data Types

This document has already includes Tibbles (e.g., `mpg`), a particularly useful version of the standard data frame used to store datasets. The other data types we'll use in the course include Dates and Factors.

A *date* is a special type used to represent date-times. For example, it is currently `r lubridate::now()`. Dates can be manipulated using the `lubridate` package.

```{r}
date <- lubridate::make_date(year = mpg$year)
```


A *factor* is a special type of *vector* used to represent categorical data values. For example, though the drive variable in the MPG dataset is represented as a character, it's probably best seen as a value from a short list of possible categories: 'f', '4', ...

```{r}
drv <- as.factor(mpg$drv)
```

The values for this variable are 'f', '4', and 'r', standing for front-wheel, 4-wheel, and rear-wheel drive respectively.

## Exploring the Data
```{r}
mpg %>% 
  count(class, sort = TRUE)
```

The type of car that shows up the most in the data set is SUV, and the least being a 2seater.
